The Input Image ID can come from either another [Image control](/image) or from an %image% template (an image dropped into your stack by the user).  The Input Image ID should be one of the following:


 * `<image_control_id>` - the ID of an Image control.
 * `%0%` … `%9%` - to specify which of the %image% templates within your stack to use.
